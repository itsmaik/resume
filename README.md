## ABOUT ME
I'm a Brazilian native who moved to Norway four years ago.

Currently, I'm finishing a higher degree in Frontend Development and am in my first year of studying System Analysis and Development. I am now seeking an internship to take all I have learned in school and apply it to real-world experience.
